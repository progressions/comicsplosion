CalendarDateSelector
====================

This is an extraction from the engines plugin by NHSB called datebocks(http://datebocks.inimit.com/).  
You DO NOT need his plugin or engines to use datebocks.

== Installation:

  $ cd RAILS_ROOT
  $ ruby script/plugin install svn://caboo.se/plugins/atmos/calendar_date_selector
  # installs the needed js/images/css/html files
  $ rake calendar:assets:install
 
== Usage:
  This plugin overrides the default date selector in FormBuilder. Code similar to the following
  will get you a datebocks entry.  You don't need to change your controllers to handle the values submitted.

  form_for(:post, @post) do |f|
    f.text_field(:title)
    f.text_area(:body)
    f.date_select(:published_on)
  end

  You can also use the date_select_tag method if you want to use it outside of FormBuilder

  form_tag do
    date_select_tag(:published_on, @post.published_on)
  end
